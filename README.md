# EIDA Metadata for EPOS

We collect in this repository all the instances of *Organization* and
*Person* that have to be informed to EPOS as part of the Metadata from EIDA.

As agreed in the ETC Meeting in Athens (May 2017), KNMI will upload soon
their examples and the rest of the nodes can use them as templates for their
own instances.
